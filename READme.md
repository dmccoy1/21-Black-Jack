### Introduction

This is a project completed apart of bootcamp provided by Betamore with Mastermnd. The project instructed us to make a Jack Black themed Blackjack game using JavaScript.

### Game Critrea

- [ ] We need to have a deck, which contains 52 cards
- [ ] The deck needs to be shuffled 
- [ ] Cards need to be dealt from the deck
- [ ] The players need to be able to have a hand of dealt cards
- [ ] The players need to have some moola, cash, DINERO
- [ ] The player needs to be able to bet moola 
- [ ] When the player wins, moola needs to be added to their bankroll
- [ ] When the player loses, moola needs to be removed from theit bankrol
- [ ] We need to implement all of the logic of "21 or Bust" aka blackjack

### Getting Started
 To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Clone it!
Clone this repo:

```git clone https://github.com/dmccoy1/21-Black-Jack---Javascript-.git```

### Prerequisites

The [prompt-sync](https://github.com/heapwolf/prompt-sync) module is needed to properly run the game. We use this module to enter input to the game from the console. I included this module as a dependency in the package.json file.

To Install, navigate to this clone directory and type into the command line:


```npm install``` or ```npm i```

### Play

Type ```node 21blackjack.js``` into the command line while you're still present in the clone directory. Do you have what it takes to beat Jack Black? ðŸ’¥
